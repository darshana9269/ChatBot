# ChatBot
Here I implemented simple chatbot using python. Simple chatbot have limited capabilities, and are usually called Rule-based bots.They are task specific.

Rule Based Chatbots:
1) Bots use set of questions and answers initially entered by programmer to respond to requests in later usage.
2) Chatbots reacts to questions or statements that match their database with appropriate answers or actions.
3) Depending on the context a chatbot is used in, it can be enhanced by additional access to external data such as customer relationship management(CRM) or enterprise resource planning(ERP) systems.
4) The more resources are made available, the more capable the system becomes.
